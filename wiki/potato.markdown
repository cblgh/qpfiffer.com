November 23 2013
================

Agenda:

* Litecoin Mining Pool
* Deaddrop time encryption and email service
* Hiking/Camping Trip
* trinque wants to dicsuss paypeer.org
* nijotz wants to discuss collaborative music streaming
* LTC &harr; BTC tenyks service
* vhost-'s Bitcoin Treasurechest
* Buying Land

Minutes:

* jnerula is in charge of setting up the mining pool for evaluation.
* Deaddrop time encryption service: Neat. Now what?
* Hiking trip December 7th to [Dog Mountain Trail,](http://www.portlandhikersfieldguide.org/wiki/Dog_Mountain_Hike)
vhost- is in charge of telling us what gear we'll need. Date may be subject to
change.
* Collaborative music streaming: Apparently there is a tenyks service that is
  mostly set up for this already, just needs to be finished and running. vhost-
said he'll do it.
* LTC &harr; BTC arbitrage/trading bot: Good idea. Don't want to do it right now.
* vhost-'s harddrive (if he brought the right one) might have a header that
  doesn't match the encrypted bits. It's also dying.
* None of us have enough money for a group land buy we'd be happy with.
  Reconsider a few years down the road.
