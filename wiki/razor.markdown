[Wet shaving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving#.22Traditional.22_wet_shaving) is a hobby of mine, and I like to collect, restore and hone
straight razors.

## Wade & Butcher Straight
[Wade & Butcher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving#.22Traditional.22_wet_shaving) straight razor with barber's notch and (probably) original
scales. I bought this one at an antique show and polished/cleaned/honed it up
myself.
