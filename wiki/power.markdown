I geek out about power consumption on a lot of my computers, and this is a
sparse collection of observations I've noticed about some of them.

## Personal Machines

### Desktop (AMD FX-8350)
* Wattage (Idle): 120
* Wattage (Peak): ?
* Notes: Measurements done with a Kill-a-Watt. Wattage for [Yamakasi Catleap
  Q270 Included](http://www.overclock.net/products/yamakasi-catleap-q270-se-27-led-2560x1440-wqhd-dvi-d-dual-computer-monitor)

### X1 Carbon (i5-3427U)
* Wattage (Idle): 7
* Wattage (Peak): 12
* Notes: Peak includes running two virtual machines and compiling some Haskell
  stuff. Idle is what I'm calling standard use with a web browser, IRC and a
  handful of terminals open.

### Thinkpad T61p (T-9300 Core2Duo)
* Wattage (Idle): 22-24
* Wattage (Peak): 32
* Notes: This thing uses power like a desktop.

## Other

### Eee PC 1000HAB (Intel Atom)
* Wattage (Idle): 7.3
* Wattage (Peak): 10
* Notes: Screen brightness is about half a watt in either direction. Battery is
  of a pretty good size, lasted about five hours.
