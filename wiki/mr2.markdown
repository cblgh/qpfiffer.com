## Update Fed. 11 2017

Car sounds terrible. Power loss. The exhaust sounds different now. I can feel
hitching sometimes as the car is accelerating or maintaining speed with the
accelerator in. I can smell burning upon exiting the car. Something is very wrong.
Muffler/exhaust work might need to be done now for real.

Update: Put in a new muffler, helked a lot.
