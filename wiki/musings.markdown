* On the fragility of programming. 

\_why was noted saying:

```
if you program and want any longevity to your work, make a game. all else
recycles, but people rewrite architectures to keep games alive.
```

which is very true. I think about BitRot a lot, and how much of history is lost
everyday because of things like [url shorteners](http://archiveteam.org/?title=URLTeam) 
or just good old fashioned maintenance. How much of code from a decade ago can
still run?

It brings up questions about formatting. Things like ASCII only work because
we've all agreed that a certain amount of bits represents a letter. This gets
trickier when things like UTF-8 (and it's [derivitives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Character_Set))
are involved.

Whats the best formatting for preserving literature, then? I think it's probably
a good idea to assume that the simpler it is to represent something, the longer
it'll stick around. This makes formats like HTML and Markdown pretty persistent,
but who knows if they'll last through this millenium. [Textfiles certainly do.](http://www.textfiles.com/)
