<p>Woke up feeling dehydrated. Went to find food.</p>
<ul>
<li>Went to eat breakfast at a place called Tai Hing (I think). Had some kind of ramen and coffee from the breakfast set. Again no black coffee.</li>
<li>Claire wanted to go to the Zoological and Botanical gardens. Headed out to central and killed a few hours looking at birds, monkeys and plants.</li>
<li>On the way back we ended up in the middle of some kind of Hong Kong motorcycle show. Got a bunch of swag and got to see some cool looking bikes.</li>
<li>We were kind of hungry so we walked to the IFC mall, looking for something that wasn’t completely swamped. For some reason there were hordes of Fillipino women eeeeeverywhere.</li>
<li>Most restaurants were occupied so we went to a little high-class cafe called Fuel. I had an espresso and some kind of brownie-cake thing. Pretty expensive there, my stuff cost $10.00 or so USD.</li>
<li>Headed out to Mong Kok to hit up the arcade again. Burned through maybe $50.0 HKD. Good times.</li>
<li>Went back to the hotel to drop of our stuff, and I showed Claire the place I’d eaten for breakfast. Day over.</li>
</ul>
<p>So tomorrow is the day we had back. It’s going to be pretty intense.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Wake up around 8 or 9 pm. Get breakfast somewhere.</li>
<li>Check out before noon.</li>
<li>Kill 5 or so hours until we should probably head to the airport to make sure we can get through customs/immigration alright.</li>
<li>Wait until our flight at 7:20 PM.</li>
<li>Fly for 10 hours. Not so bad!</li>
<li>Get to Vancouver at approximately 3:40 PM. Leave at 6:300 PM. Get to Portland at 7:16 PM. 4 minutes earlier than when we left Hong Kong!</li>
<li>Get a ride home.</li>
<li>Fall asleep for 12 hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>Observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordering and paying for food is a little different here than in America. Since theres no tipping, theres usually a 10% service fee. You usually have to get someone’s attention. Service is usually pretty quick.</li>
<li>Food is pretty damn cheap, breakfast was something like $3.50USD.</li>
<li>My nose is always plugged up here. Air quality?</li>
<li>EVERYTHING is sweetened. The cultural war on bitterness continues.</li>
<li>There is very little graffiti. It’s actually pretty damn clean in this regard. Even Sham Shui Po isn’t that bad.</li>
</ul>
