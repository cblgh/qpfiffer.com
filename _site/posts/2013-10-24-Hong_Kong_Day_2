<p>This is the most capitalist country on the face of the planet. There cannot possibly be a place where more money changes hands every second.</p>
<ul>
<li>Woke up a little before 6 AM, decided to check out Wan Chai and Mong Kok a bit.</li>
<li>Had coffee at a Starbucks in the mall near out hostel.</li>
<li>Took the train out to Tsim Sha Tsui, walked up and down Nathan road for a bit.</li>
<li>Dropped by the Chung King mansions at around 8 AM, it’s reputation of shadiness is not exagerated. Armed security everywhere. Most places were not open so we left.</li>
<li>Meandered down to the promenade, saw the star ferry and the bay. Watched the boats for a while.</li>
<li>Somehow found out way onto the avenue of stars. Walked a long that, lots of tourists from all over.</li>
<li>Decided to eat somewhere. Settled on the Mido Cafe.</li>
<li>Took the train up to Yau Ma Tei, ate lunch. Nice little place right next to a park. Pretty cheap, too.</li>
<li>Claire wanted to see the bird market so we wandered towards that. A lot of walking.</li>
<li>Found our way to the flower market first, it’s so far the only place that hasn’t smelled like car exhaust.</li>
<li>Went to the bird market. Very loud, birds everywhere.</li>
<li>Headed back to the train station, went to Wan Chai</li>
<li>Looked around the Wan Chai computer center. Nothing of immediate interest, although there was another mechanical keyboard place at this one which I looked through for a bit.</li>
<li>Our feet were pretty tired by this point so we decided to head home. Got some cash and charged up our octopus cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan now is to hang out and rest at the hotel for a bit, then check out some kind of light show at night. Maybe go to a restaurant or something.</p>
<ul>
<li>Went to a place called Ipuudu HK for ramen. Pretty good. They’d scream out japanese a la pizza schmizza everytime someone did certain things.</li>
<li>Went to see the Hong Kong nighttime skyline from the kowloon waterfront. Looked glorious.</li>
<li>Rode the star ferry back over the bay to get to the Wan Chai stop. It only cost 2.5 HKD.</li>
<li>I wanted to stop at the Wan Chai computer market again but pretty much evertyhing was closed by 9 PM or so.</li>
</ul>
<p>Observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>There seems to be no cultural idea of walking in a certain pattern. Walkways are pretty much anything goes, despite the road systems having a ‘left lane is moving forward’ thing. Very odd.</li>
<li>This is probably just the result of really only being out during the work day, but there is a definite ‘get to work, get back home’ kind of zombie-vibe coming from the commuters. Everyone is buried in their phones or looking down or reading the newspaper.</li>
<li>7-11, circle-k, starbucks and McDonalds are all pretty popular here.</li>
</ul>
