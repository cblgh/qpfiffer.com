<p>On November 2nd, 2013 I won <a href="http://thelistserve.com/">the listserve</a> lottery. If you don’t know anything about the listserve, it’s a daily newsletter where the writer is randomly selected from the subscribers. This is why the call it the lottery.</p>
<p>I must’ve signed up for the thing a couple of months ago, and the list consists of more or less 25,000 people. It’s kind of a wonder I won, considering the short period of time I’ve been subscribed.</p>
<p>Most of the emails on the listserve are semi-preachy life-lesson things, with a moral or a sob story or something. I decided I was sick of all of that so I threw together a nonsense haiku in a couple of minutes and sent it off:</p>
<pre><code>Subject: Drink Your Orange Juice

A Giraffe can't lose
Have to go buy staplers
You're Standing on it</code></pre>
<p>I thought nothing more of it and went on with my week. Friday, November 8th it went out. At around noon I checked my phone for email and general notifications, and was surprised to see 14 or so new emails in my inbox. I’m not that popular so it was kind of a shock.</p>
<p>Since November 8th I have received (in response):</p>
<ul>
<li>38 Emails from different people
<ul>
<li>Of these emails, about a quarter liked the email address I used, <code>shithouse@goatse.cx</code>.</li>
<li>Some where genuinely confused by the haiku and demanded answers</li>
<li>A handful of people congratulated me</li>
<li>One guy sent three seperate pictures of Jesus</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Two twitter users (or more) tweeted the poem</li>
<li>One enterprising guy found me on twitter and sent me a picture of a giraffe</li>
<li>Three or four people said it was top five listserve material</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as traffic goes, nothing really changed. It seems some people were more than content to take the haiku at face value and move on with their lives.</p>
<p>What do I take away from this? People will look for meaning anywhere, and they genuinely seem to enjoy diversity. Or something. Really I sent a haiku to a ton of people and thats awesome.</p>
