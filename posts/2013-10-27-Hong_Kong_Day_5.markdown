Woke up feeling dehydrated. Went to find food.

* Went to eat breakfast at a place called Tai Hang (I think). Had some kind of
  ramen and coffee from the breakfast set. Again no black coffee.

Observations:

* Ordering and paying for food is a little different here than in America. Since
  theres no tipping, theres usually a 10% service fee. You usually have to get
someone's attention. Service is usually pretty quick.
* Food is pretty damn cheap, breakfast was something like $3.50USD.
