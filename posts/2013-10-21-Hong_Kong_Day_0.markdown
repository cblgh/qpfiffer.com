Alright, after getting some sleep I am feeling a lot better. I am writing this
at 6:36 AM local time.

* Claire and I got to the Portland airport at something like 7 AM, fog everywhere
* Got to Vancouver around noon
* Claire and I had lunch, did some people watching. A lot of interesting people
  there. Big nice aquarium.
* Left at around 2 PM, the flight begins. From here everyone on the plane closes
  their windows. Cant see anything.
* We fly up the west coast of Canada, over the Aleutian islands, across the
  international dateline, down over Japan, along the east coast of China and
  finally landing on Hong Kong. I know this because I watched the map the whole
  time.
* Landed just after sunset, and proceeded down a series of walkways and paths to
  get to a terminal train that would take us to the rest of the airport.
* Rode an automated train to the main terminal
* Made it through immigration with no fuss. No fancy stamp though, they stapled
  some piece of paper to my passport.
* Customs was even easier, I thought I was going to have to declare my cell
  phone or something but they just waved us through.
* Next began our train adventure. We didn't get Octopus cards right away because
  we didn't have any cash (almost all of the octopus machines take cash only)
and instead got two group tickets leaving the Hong Kong airport for  $16.00 USD.
We ended up only needing one so I'll use the other when we leave.
* Got to the Hong Kong island termianal, and after messing around on the wrong
  floor for a while we made it to the Island Line area, where we couldn't get
tickets because the machine only took cash. Some employee helped us purchase
Octopus cards and sent us on our way. The people here are pretty nice.
* Rode the island line all the way down to Chai Wan, it was pretty crowded. The
  train was huge, like 8 or 9 cars, and you could walk from one end of it to the
other.
* I was a little dissapointed the second line we were on (the island line) was
  mostly underground.) The first line was overland though and it was awesome.
There are these huge apartment buildings everywhere.
* After messing around for a bit (got lost in some kind of money-sieve mall at
  the end of the train station) we made it up to our apartment.
