* Woke up around 7. Decided to go to the peak.
* Tried to eat breakfast at the iconic bar, but they weren't open.
* Decided to seek breakfast elsewhere. Grabbed a fish cutlet bun and a donut
  from a place called the Yamakazi bakery, coffee from Starbucks and went to the
little square outside of our building.
* Went to the peak. Nice view, didn't want to pay the fee to get to the top of
  the terrace thing so we found somewhere else to view from. Got out just as the
Saturday morning crowds started to show up.
* Went to Sham Shui Po again to look at the toy shops and what-have-you. Picked
  up some souvenir-ish things and left after a couple of hours.
* Went to Ippudu for a late lunch
* Now back at the building.

No plan for the rest of the day. I think I'm ready to go home.
